Project Overview
In this dynamic mini sprint I stepped into the role of a data analyst, embarking on a journey to implement predictive analytics techniques aimed at solving the critical of Attrition at the fictional company Bain & Comapany. Kim Wexler, the Head of Human Resources has provided raw company data that provided insight into the attrition plaguging her company.

Dataset
Comapny data ranging from salaries, years with the cmopany, previous work history, and other unique employee categories were provided. Also categories not relavaent to the the problem at hand were removed from the set. 

Data Cleaning
Before this dataset was analyzied it was purged of invalid or empty data.  

Visualizations
After preprocessing the the raw dataset various data points were visualized utilizing colab.  

Models
Multiple predictive models were asseesed but ultimately logistical predictive model was selected because it was most effective in determining binary outcomes 

Solutions
After analyzing the data and logistic models the recommendations that I decided on were to offer remote/hybrid working options to compensate the distance travled. Younger employees have higher attrition rates, so there needs to be efforts made to increase retention rates 

Mini Sprint Reflections
With this being my first Mini Sprint with Clicked and my first offical exposure to Data Analysis & Machine Learning this has been an overall good experience. this was my first tine programming since I graduated college over seven years ago. My lack of coding familarity definetly made this experince more difficult but I welcomed the added difficulity. Throught this entire course I was consulting previous Clicked Experiences, various coding foourms, and generative AI tools to compnesate for my lack of knowledge. Due to other commitments I was the only person on my team to work on and comepelte the sprint. This taught me that to make it in this career field I will need the inner fortitude to accomplish my goals!
